### Developing locally


If you have never run a Rails project on your machine, you might want to consult [something like this](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.10-yosemite) to help get Ruby, Bundler, and the like all setup. If you have any questions at all, feel free to email [James](https://github.com/jamesdabbs) or post on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/atlrug-rhok).

To get started with a local copy of the project, run

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:PeaceCorps/medlink.git
$ bundle --without production
$ rake db:setup
```

*Optional* admin setup. Make sure git is [configured](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) globally as this becomes your admin username. 

```bash
$ rake admin:create
```

and you should be off to the races. You can check your setup by running the specs with

```bash
$ rake spec
```

If it's green, you should be good to go. You can also generate a coverage report by running `rake coverage`.

Then create a pull request and we will review it and merge it into the repo.
We also use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/PeaceCorps/medlink) for Continuous
Integration.
